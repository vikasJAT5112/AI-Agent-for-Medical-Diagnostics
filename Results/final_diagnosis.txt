### Final Diagnosis:

- **Panic Disorder/Anxiety-Related Episodes:**
  - All three reports highlight symptoms consistent with panic attacks, such as intense chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, dizziness, sweating, and a feeling of impending doom. The patient's history of anxiety and the normal cardiac evaluations further support this diagnosis.

- **Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD):**
  - Both the cardiologist and pulmonologist reports suggest GERD as a potential cause of the patient's symptoms, including chest pain and respiratory issues. GERD can mimic cardiac symptoms and exacerbate respiratory symptoms due to acid reflux irritating the airways.

- **Anxiety-Induced Hyperventilation:**
  - The pulmonologist report points to anxiety-induced hyperventilation as a possible cause of the patient's shortness of breath and chest discomfort during panic attacks. This aligns with the patient's history of anxiety and the nature of his symptoms.
